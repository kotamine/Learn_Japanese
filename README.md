# Learn Japanese Project

We provide self-study materials for learning Japanese, focusing on **listening skills.**  
We think that *Studio Ghibli* movies (which are equivalent to Disney movies in Japan) can be a great study resource. You can listen and follow simple conversations in fun stories, and hopefully you can watch them repeatedly. You can find most Ghibli movies (original Japanese versions) on Youtube (when accessed from the U.S. for example -- if needed, use a VPN service to get around the IP address region barrier).      
- Know the overall story and the details of conversations (knowing the contents exactly will help you focus on listening)
    - We provide a line-by-line/side-to-side translation and a movie-specific vocabulary list as an excel file.
- Try watching with Japanese subtitles 
    -  (you might have to physically hide the embedded English subtitles and overlay a custom movie file with Japanese subtitles) 
    - (we will work on providing this)  
- Try watching without any subtitles
- Try doing a role play with a part of the movie 
    - (we will work on providing this)


Once you can watch about a half dozen or all of the Ghibli movies without subtitles, you can try watching youtube videos posted by Japanese people in the general subject you are interested in. That way, you can keep learning and practicing your listening skills from real-world contents.
