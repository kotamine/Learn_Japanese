One, get off the horse!
I'm horse-sick!
Don't go far.
If you stray, you'll never find your way back.
We'd better go back.
What is it?
I don't know.
Got it! There it is!
Holy shit.
We did it!
Indy.
Indy, where are they?
Indiana.
Utah, 1912.
That's the cross Cortez gave to Coronado in 1520.
It should be in a museum.
I want you to tell your captain that we found the thieves.
Sheriff.
Snakes.
You got it?
"Report to the captain and call the sheriff."
So, what do you say?
I don't know. I'll think of something.
Shut up and dig.
You got it.
Captain! Where are you?
We're all lost.
Hold on!
Get him!
Get out of the way.
Come on, boy.
Give it up.
Whip him.
Not bad. Let's have it.
No!
The Coronado clan is dead.
We'll put it in the museum.
Give me that!
The house of magic?
No, no, no. I'll go.
There you go. Come on, get out of there.
Oh, shit!
Dad!
Jones.
Oh, my God.
Count to 20.
Junior!
It's Greek.
"He who gives the light of glory..."
"Let there be light."
Sheriff.
Sheriff, in the cave...
That's enough.
Where's the crucifix?
It's right here.
The owner...
He's willing to forget you ever stole it.
I've got all the witnesses I need.
So...
You've lost.
But don't lose heart.
Off the coast of Portugal, 1938.
Small world, huh?
Not to you and me.
This is the second time I've gotten it back from you.
It belongs in a museum.
Don't you?
Throw him in the water!
Get him, now!
Archaeology is all about facts.
Not truth.
If you're interested in truth, go to philosophy class.
There is no such thing as a lost city or buried treasure.
There is no such thing as lost cities or buried treasure, because no treasure has ever been found by digging up an X on a map.
Seventy percent of all archaeological research is done in libraries.
You have to read and study the literature.
Don't believe the legends.
Next week...
Next week, we'll be talking about the excavation of an ancient Egyptian tomb.
If you have any questions, please come see me in my lab.
Marcus, we did it.
You did it!
I finally got it back.
Half my life.
Half my life.
Well done, Indy.
Let's go to the "History of the Spanish Conquest" exhibit.
Let's have a champagne toast tonight.
On the house.
Sure.
My treat.
The mail is on your desk. Here's a note from your phone.
And I'd like you to grade my final exam.
Quiet! I'll take turns asking questions.
I'll take my turn. Quiet!
"Venice, Italy."
Dr. Jones.
Dr. Jones.
I'm sorry to call you here on such short notice.
I'm sure you're surprised.
Walter Donovan.
It's you, isn't it? You've always been a generous donor to the museum.
It's an impressive collection.
I've always been as interested in ancient objects as you are.
What do you make of this?
Sandstone slabs, crosses...
It's ancient Latin, mid-12th century.
I think so, too.
Where did you get this?
My mining engineer found it in the mountains north of Ankara...
Can you translate that?
"The Lord said, 'Whoever drinks of this water...
"He who drinks of this water..." "will find within himself a holy spring..."
"and shall have eternal life."
"Lead me to your holy mountain."
"across the desert and over the mountains.
"across the valley of the crescent moon."
"to the temple of the Holy Grail."
"where the chalice is hung with the blood of Christ."
It's the Holy Grail.
At the Last Supper, Jesus drank the wine.
The blood of the crucified man.
Into the hands of Joseph of Arimathea.
It's from the legend of King Arthur.
Whoever drinks from the chalice will have eternal life!
Even in legend, it's a dream.
An old man's dream.
It must have been your father's dream, too.
The legend of the Holy Grail is a hobby. I'm a professor of medieval literature.
You're not going to leave our guest alone, are you?
I'll be right there.
What do you think? It contains the location of the Holy Grail.
I don't know.
It's written in deserts, mountains and valleys.
It's too vague.
If we could just find this part, we'd have more clues.
I've already had them start looking.
Let me tell you the rest of the legend.
The chalice in the hands of Joseph of Arimathea was lost for a thousand years.
It was found by three knights, brothers who joined the crusades.
I know the story.
Two of the brothers spent the next 150 years fleeing the desert.
Only one of them returned to his native France.
He lived an amazingly long life, and before he died, he told the monks.
He told the monks everything.
It's not a legend, Doctor.
This is the book that the monk wrote.
"The place where the chalice is enshrined...
"There are two keys to find it."
This tablet is one of them. It confirms the legend.
The missing piece...
It was found in the grave of a brother who died on the way here.
According to the head of our expedition, the tomb is in Venice.
What do you think, Doctor?
I think that 2,000 years of holy search is about to come to fruition.
Just one more step.
It's always about that one step.
You're right.
There was a stumbling block at the end...
The head of the survey team has gone missing, along with all his files.
I received a telegram from Dr. Schneider, who's been working with me...
And that's why I'm asking for your help.
I need you to find him. I need the Chalice.
To the other Jones.
The chalices are my father's specialty.
I've already asked. It's your father who's missing.
I'm an old friend of your father's.
I'm an old friend of your father's. You don't get along with him. Why all of a sudden?
The worm in the library has left the house.
Dad!
Oh, my God.
What the hell is going on here?
I don't know. I've got a bad feeling about this.
Dad!
A letter came today. It's been opened.
A letter? I forgot this.
It's from Venice.
What's in it?
My father's notebook.
It contains all the details and discoveries of the Grail investigation.
A lifetime's worth of data. Why would he give it to me?
Someone's been after it.
Do you believe it?
Do you believe the Holy Grail really exists?
To seek the Holy Grail is to seek God.
I don't know where it is, but...
But at my age, I'm inclined to believe.
Call Donovan. Tell him I'm flying to Venice.
Make arrangements for two.
Who's picking you up?
Dr. Schneider will be there.
He's staying at my apartment.
Dr. Jones, good luck.
Be careful. You can't trust anyone.
"Venice."
Venice is good.
Have you ever seen the face of a man named Schneider?
He's gonna try to talk to you.
Dr. Jones?
I knew it. You have your father's eyes.
The ears are like her mother's. The rest is yours.
Only your eyes and ears are better.
Dr. Marcus?
I'm Elsa Schneider.
Your father and I were in the library researching the Knights' Cemetery.
He was so excited. He said, "We're almost there."
My father was excited? Unbelievable.
Here, if you don't mind.
No, thank you.
I'd love to.
No, thank you.
Good.
It'll be dead by tomorrow.
I know you're in my way, but I need to work.
Look at this note.
Your father asked me to find an old map of the town.
When I came back, your father was nowhere to be found.
I found this scribbled note.
Roman numerals.
That's the library.
That's the library?
That's the original church?
That's right. It was built in the Holy Land.
These columns were brought back from Turkey by the Crusaders.
The Crusaders brought them back from Turkey as trophies.
It's closing time. I'll see what I can do to get you to stay.
Marcus, I've seen this window before.
It's my father's notebook.
This is it.
Look, it's Roman numerals.
This is the key.
What do those numbers mean?
Until we figure that out, we can't talk about the notebook.
What are they?
Three, seven and ten. They match the Roman numerals in the note.
It's true.
My father wasn't looking for a reference, he was looking for the tomb itself.
The tomb is in this building.
This building used to be a church.
"Three."
"Three."
"Seven." "Seven."
"Ten."
Where's "10"?
Where is it?
Find the ten.
"Ten"!
It's an X.
There it is!
That's your father's son.
I beat your father.
Put me down.
Hold this for me.
It's pagan. 4th or 5th century.
That's 600 years before the Crusades began.
After that, the Christians dug their own tombs.
But it's possible that some of the earliest crusader knights are buried here.
What's this?
It's the Ark of the Covenant.
I'm sure of it.
Take it.
It's oil. It's got to be worth something.
Fire.
Look.
Which one?
This is it.
Look at this work. It's wonderful.
That's it.
Yes! We found it!
Look.
The writing on the shield...
It's the same as the writing on the tablet.
This shield is the second key!
What's that?
It's the writing on the tablet that my father copied.
You're excited.
If your father were here...
He can't come. He hates rats to death.
Get back!
Get back under the coffin!
Stay here. Stay here.
There's a way out. Breathe in!
Venice is good.
Do not go through that door!
We're going through that?
Why did you go in there?
You told me to get out of the way!
No, I said, "Stay in the gap!"
Why are you trying to kill me?
Because I'm looking for the chalices!
Is that why you killed my father?
No! No!
Where is he now?
Tell me or I'll kill you!
Tell me!
Get off me! You'll die, too!
I don't care.
I'm ready to die.
This is your last chance!
This is your last chance.
Tell me where your father is.
Help me and I'll tell you.
Who are you?
I'm Kazim.
Why did you attack me?
The secret of the Holy Grail has been kept for a thousand years.
All those years.
The Holy Grail has been guarded by the Crossed Swords Brotherhood.
Get me there.
Why are you...
Why do you seek the Holy Grail?
For the glory of God?
Not your glory?
It's my father I'm looking for.
In that case, I'll help you.
Brunwald Castle, on the Austrian-German border.
Are you hurt?
I'll be fine.
What's the name of the town, Alexandretta?
It's the town where the First Crusaders held the castle for a year.
Eventually, the town was destroyed.
Now it's a town called Iskenderun.
The tablet said.
"Across the desert, over the mountains, to the Valley of the Crescent Moon."
And where is that?
If my father were here...
Yes, yes! That's the map!
I pieced together the clues to make this map.
First, there's a town with an oasis to the east.
South of the desert, there's a river and a mountain.
Then there's a valley.
The question is, what's the name of the town we're starting from?
Alexandretta.
I'm sure of it!
I'll call my friend Salah.
And you?
I'm going to help my father.
Elsa?
Oh, my God.
What do they want?
This.
Your father's?
You never trusted me. You never told me.
But I made you follow me here.
What kind of a woman follows you around with one flower?
Why don't you tell me the truth?
You've changed your mind about me, haven't you?
Don't be so vain. I saved you, too!
I've been in a lot of trouble since I got here.
I've been set on fire, drowned, nearly cut to pieces.
My dad found some kind of important key.
Until we figure it out, I'm going to do things my way.
How dare you kiss me!
I hate women who touch men.
I hate men who talk big. I hate men who talk big.
Venice is nice.
Salzburg.
We're here.
The owner of the castle is an art collector.
What are we gonna do?
I'll think of a plan.
Slowpoke!
If you don't open the door soon, I'll be soaking wet.
Look, I've got the flu.
Who is it?
Who is it? Tell your husband.
"Lord Macdonald is here to see you."
He's come with his beautiful assistant to see the tapestry.
A tapestry?
He's an idiot.
Don't castles have wall hangings?
Yes, I do. More than I can count!
And you're a Scottish nobleman. That's funny.
Rude!
Nazi. I hate Nazis.
This room.
How do you know?
Hidden microphone.
Indy.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
Junior?
It's you, Junior.
Please don't call me "Junior."
What are you doing here?
I'm here to help my dad...
It's from the 14th century, Ming Dynasty.
How dare you...
That's my bump.
I can't get it back.
It'll heal.
Good.
It's not real.
I can tell by the cracks.
Let's get the hell out of here.
I thought it was one of them, so I hit him.
They'll go through the door.
Yeah, well, so are they.
Well, sometimes you're wrong.
But it wasn't a mistake to send the notebook.
I got it.
I found the cemetery.
In the basement of the library?
Yeah.
I knew it. You found the knight's coffin?
Yes, sir.
I knew it. I knew it.
What was in the coffin?
Decayed remains.
Did you find a shield?
What did the shield say?
"Alexandretta."
Alexandretta!
That's the Turkish town the pilgrims came from.
Nice work, Junior.
This is the culmination of 40 years of my father's research.
I wish I could have been there.
The rats...
Rats?
A big one. And the Nazis?
He wants the notebook.
It's not safe for you to have it, so I sent it to him.
Dr. Jones.
I'll take the notebook.
What notebook?
The pocket notebook.
My son has a pocket notebook?
You think I'm that stupid?
You didn't...
You brought it?
What an asshole!
We'll talk about this later.
How could you be so stupid?
Calm down!
I didn't want it in their hands. That's why I sent it!
I'm here to help!
You're the mummy's mummy, Junior!
Dad!
Don't say "Junior" to me!
Oh, my God!
Are you out of your mind?
Elsa.
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot her.
She's an enemy too.
Help me.
She's a Nazi.
She's an enemy.
I'll kill you.
Yes, I will.
Don't kill her!
I'm not gonna kill you.
Indy, please.
Don't let them fool you.
I'll shoot you!
No, no, no!
I'm sorry.
It's okay, sweetheart.
You should have listened to your father.
You've trashed the room, you've made a play...
How did you know?
How did you know she was a Nazi?
You said so in your sleep.
Because you trust women!
I warned you, didn't I?
Donovan.
I told you not to trust anyone, didn't I?
I've always thought you were a man who would sell his mother for a collection.
But I never thought I'd sell my country and my soul to these scum.
Look, the pages have been ripped out.
There must have been a map with no place names.
It's an exact map from one town to the Valley of the Crescent Moon.
Exactly.
Where are the torn pages?
I'm not going to talk to you.
You don't have to.
He gave the map to you.
To Dr. Marcus.
Marcus? You dragged him into this, too?
He's a high-profile case. They'll catch him.
He's not gonna get caught.
He's two days ahead of us.
He's fluent in the language and customs of the region. He's got friends everywhere he goes.
He'll blend in and be impossible to find.
He may have already found the chalice.
Do any of you speak English?
No water. Give it to the fish.
"Iskenderun."
I'm not buying any of this.
I'm sorry, but I'm a vegetarian.
I don't understand a word of it.
Doctor!
Salah, thank God.
It's been a long time! Where's Indy?
She took a detour to Austria.
Are you on your own?
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
What about the food I asked for?
I've got everything I need.
Here's a map to help you get started.
Doctor.
Welcome.
We're here to pick you up from the local museum.
That's very kind of you.
That's very kind of you.
This way, please.
How gracious.
We don't have a museum here.
Papers, please.
Papers? I'm here.
Get out of here.
Here's the paper you finished reading. Go ahead.
Run.
The Egyptian.
Run?
Run! Go to the entrance.
This is outrageous.
Dr. Schneider, back in Berlin.
To the Aryan Cultural Congress.
I have orders from the highest authorities to attend.
I'll see you in Turkey.
This one goes to Berlin.
It's useless without the map. Use it to score some points.
We'll kill them both.
We'll still need it in case we can't find the map.
She's right.
You hate me that much?
It's for the Chalice. You would've done the same thing.
Speak for yourself.
But I'm glad you did.
Thank you. I couldn't agree more.
Dr. Schneider.
The car's ready.
Austrian way of saying goodbye.
And this is the German way.
I prefer the Austrian way.
So do I.
Come on, let's get you untied and get you back to Markus.
He's not worried about being alone, is he?
You're not worried? He's a man lost in his own museum.
Left pocket.
What pocket?
We can escape.
Lighter.
It'll burn through the rope.
Good idea.
We need to talk.
We'll talk about the sad stuff later.
The floor's on fire.
Here.
And the chair.
Important documents.
The map that led us to Marcus... it's ours.
From Berlin.
From the Führer. "To protect the secret of the matter.
"to protect the secrets of the American father and son."
This is the end of Jones and his son.
Let's go.
Dad!
Come on!
To the fireplace!
You're loosening up.
We're both in bad shape.
That's good.
We're almost there.
Enemy!
Come on!
Take the shot!
Oh, my God.
It's done.
All right.
After them!
Come on, come on!
Come with me.
Come on, come on.
No, no, no.
There must be a secret exit.
The passageway...
Let's just sit back and figure it out.
Come on, let's figure it out.
Another ship.
Is it like this every day?
Not today.
Dad, come on!
I thought we were going to the boat.
Get after the boat!
Get after it! Don't let him get away!
Berlin. Venice.
Stop.
You're going the wrong way. Go to Berlin.
This way.
The notebook's in Berlin.
Markus has the map.
The map is not enough.
Not enough? Why not?
It's the final test to get the chalice.
The final test?
Three traps that will kill you.
The traps?
I found a way to pass through them safely in an ancient text.
What did the book say?
You don't remember?
I wrote it down in my notebook so I wouldn't have to remember it.
A wanted man in the German army going to Berlin, their home base?
More importantly, the Chalice.
What about Markus?
He'd say the same thing.
Oh, God! A martyr who abandons his own body.
Don't you dare blaspheme.
This is more than an archeological battle.
This is a battle between good and evil.
If the chalice is taken by the nazis.
If the Nazis take the Holy Grail, this world will be darkened.
Don't you see?
You are obsessed with the Holy Grail! You don't understand.
I don't!
Even your mother...
She knew what I was going through.
But she kept me in the dark about her illness.
And then...
We are pilgrims to an unholy land.
Dr. Schneider.
Where's my notebook?
I'll take the notebook!
Why do you need that notebook now?
I don't want it burned.
I don't believe in Nazis. I believe in the Holy Grail.
You've helped the Nazis. Now you're playing games with me!
I'm telling the truth!
Do you want to be strangled to death?
I'll scream at the top of my lungs.
We got it back. Let's get out of here.
Adolf Hitler.
"Berlin Airport"
First flight out of Germany.
You're safe now.
That's what I'll tell them when we take off and leave Germany.
You'll be fine.
Hold on. I'll check inside.
Do you recognize this man?
I've never seen him before.
Tickets, please.
May I see your ticket, please?
Hello, Dr. Jones.
Tickets, please.
Tickets, please.
Free ride!
I'm going to get you!
It's been quite an experience, sharing your adventures with you.
We've shared many others.
With a woman who looks like my granddaughter.
I'm only human.
Father and son, the same woman...
Fate is a strange thing.
Do you know the last thing I drank with you?
Milk.
What did you talk about?
We never...
I never did.
Is that an accusation?
Regret.
One father, one child, and yet we were separated.
I always envied kids who had normal fathers.
I was a good father.
"Don't leave food on the table," "wash your ears," "do your homework."
I respected your freedom. I instilled in you a sense of independence.
My father was more than just me.
I was more important to him than a man who died 500 years ago.
So for 20 years, I didn't see him much.
By the time I got around to talking to him, he'd moved out.
All right. All right.
You can tell me anything.
Nothing, sir.
Then why are you complaining?
It's not about that. It's about this.
The three trials of Alexandretta are these.
"First, the breath of God."
"Repent and pass."
"Second, the word of God."
"Follow in the footsteps of God."
"Third, the way of God."
"Show courage by jumping off the lion's head."
What are you talking about?
We don't know until we get there.
We're turning.
We're going back to Germany.
They must have found out we broke the radio.
Now!
Can you fly this thing?
I can fly the plane!
No landing.
I want machine gun fire now!
It's 11:00!
It's 11:00!
What happens at 11:00?
That's the direction! Twelve o'clock. Eleven o'clock. Shoot!
Did you get shot?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Crash landing. Hang on!
Nice work.
He's gonna kill us.
I know!
I've never done this before.
I've done it before.
This is outrageous!
Get over there.
Go faster!
That was a close call.
They're turning back!
Carl the Great says...
"My army is trees on rocks."
"and birds in the sky!"
Republic of Hatay.
This is part of Professor Jones' notebook.
It contains a map showing the location of the Holy Grail.
It's in His Highness' territory.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask his permission first.
Of course, I've prepared a suitable reward.
What do you mean by "thank you"?
All this treasure.
A collection from one of Germany's finest families.
Rolls-Royce Phantom II.
4.3-liter, 30-horsepower, six-cylinder engine.
Stromberg carburetor.
Acceleration time to 100 kilometers per hour...
12.5 seconds.
Great color.
Keys are included.
We'll have everything. Camels, horses, bodyguards, food.
Desert vehicles. Tanks.
Thank you, sir.
We have to hurry. Jones and his son are gone.
This way.
Get that camel out of here!
What about Marcus?
He's with them. They went out into the desert today.
They took the map...
You don't get a reward for coming in second.
Would you like a sip?
I'd spit on you, but I don't have any spit.
According to this map, we should be three or four miles from here.
Marcus.
The greatest treasure left to mankind is now at hand.
You don't know the true power of that treasure.
Marcus.
He's safe.
It's a tank.
He's got a gun.
No, no, no, no, no!
You can't reach this far.
My brother's car...
There's no one here.
There's been a mistake.
It's Jones. I've got a hunch.
Take the hostages to the tank.
In this heat, without a car, they'll die of natural causes.
I knew it was him.
Who are these people?
I don't know, but they're alive.
Stay here. I'll find your legs.
We'll steal a horse.
And the camel.
I don't want a camel.
I don't want a camel!
Who's this?
It's a divine messenger.
The Holy Grail.
The Holy Grail brings eternal damnation to the wicked.
Marcus.
We are men of learning!
Learning is our master!
Henry! Henry!
Let's get out of here.
I need a physical.
Why is this filthy little notebook so important to you, Henry?
Why is it so important that you're willing to risk going to Berlin for it?
Don't hide it!
Tell me what it says.
"You Nazis..."
"If you read the book without burning it, you will become a little smarter."
Colonel! Jones is gone.
He's...
Here he is.
It's the other Jones!
I thought I told you I didn't want the camel!
I'm giving you your camel back because I'm taking your car off the road.
Where's your father?
They got him.
He's in the iron car.
There he is.
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
Don't move!
Dad! Dad!
Junior!
Dad!
Pick it up!
[Claire] You look like an idiot.
You did it.
You know what they say. "The pen is mightier than the sword."
You're being violent.
It's war!
You should be thanking me!
Dad.
Is this archeology?
Get out of here!
How do we get down here?
Where's Marcus?
Stay with me!
Indy's dad!
Salah!
Get my dad!
Give me your hand!
Junior!
Indy!
Oh, my God.
That boy...
He didn't talk to me. He didn't...
I can't believe this is happening.
If I'd had five minutes...
I thought he was dead.
It's a miracle.
You did good.
Let's go.
Come on, come on!
Don't just sit there!
Come quickly!
This is it. This is the Valley of the Crescent Moon.
Let's get another one!
It's good to see you again.
You're a persistent bastard.
Dr. Schneider, stand back.
He's going for the chalices.
You think that's funny? He's going down in history.
As a Nazi collaborator?
Nazi? You're not thinking clearly.
Nazis use the Holy Grail as a tool to take over the world.
I don't care.
I'm here for the Grail itself and eternal life.
I will conquer the world.
Hitler will die, and I will stay.
You will get my chalices.
And you shoot me?
It makes sense.
Let's shoot me.
Father.
Dad!
Junior...
Back off!
You want to save him, don't you?
Only the power of the Holy Grail can save him.
You just have to figure out what to do.
"Breath of God."
"Repent and pass."
"Repent and go through."
"Repent and go through."
"Repent and..."
"Repent and go through."
"Repent and go through."
Repent and pass. Repent and pass. Repent and...
A repentant man is a humble man.
The repentant are humble. They kneel.
Get down on your knees!
We're through!
We made it.
We're safe.
Not yet.
The second test is the word of God.
"Follow in the footsteps of God."
"The word of God."
"The word..."
"Follow in the footsteps of God."
"The word of God."
Henry, don't move.
The name of God...
The name of God...
JEHOVAH.
Latin for "God."
The spelling begins with an "I."
"J."
The Latin spelling is "I."
"I."
"E."
"H."
"O."
"V."
"A."
"God's way."
"Jump off the lion's head..."
"and show your courage."
It's impossible. You can't fly.
Indy! Dad can't hold on.
Hurry!
We have to believe in God. We have to fly. It's the only way.
We have to believe.
Trust...
Fly!
There you are.
I'm running out of energy.
What about you?
The last of the three brothers.
I found the chalices, and I kept them safe.
For 700 years?
Long enough.
That's an odd-looking knight you have there.
Not a knight.
But why?
I was chosen for this office as a knight of valor.
But that honor will remain...
Until someone challenges me to a one-on-one fight.
And now you have defeated me.
This is for you.
I'm here because...
Which one?
You must choose.
The right cup.
Choose right, and you will live forever.
Choose wrongly, and you die.
I'm not a historian. I can't tell the difference.
I'll choose.
Please.
There it is.
It's more beautiful than I imagined.
A cup fit for a king among kings.
Eternal life!
I don't understand.
I made a choice.
I made the wrong choice.
It's not gold.
Jesus was a carpenter.
This is how I know.
You made the right choice.
Don't take the cup outside the crest on the floor.
That's the boundary.
The boundary that holds eternal life.
Drop the gun.
Father, get up.
It's ours!
Elsa! Stay where you are!
We own you!
No! Do not take the Grail outside that sigil.
Junior!
Elsa!
Elsa, no!
Come on, give me your hand!
I'm almost there.
Give me your hand!
Junior! Junior! Give me your hand!
I'm almost there.
Indiana.
Indiana.
Leave her alone.
Let's go.
To Elsa, the Chalice was just another treasure.
What did you get out of it?
Me?
I got the light.
Junior.
Don't say "Junior."
What do you mean, "Junior"?
Henry Jones II, Junior. That's his name.
Indiana.
That's the name of the dog I had.
Come on, let's get you home.
Your dog's name?
That's your dog's name.
He was a very good dog.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Follow me! I got this.
You're lost in your own museum.
